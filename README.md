Shorty
================

Simple URL shortener microservice powered by Sinatra and PostgreSQL.

## Install

First clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tegon/shorty.git
```

Inside the application directory, build the Docker images running:
```bash
cd shorty
docker-compose build
```

Create and start the containers:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

We need to restart the containers because the `app` container will fail to start until the database is created:
```bash
docker-compose restart
```
You might have to wait a minute before doing this.

Run the database migrations:
```bash
docker-compose run app rake db:migrate
```

Restart (again) because `Sequel` needs to read the database schema on initialize:
```bash
docker-compose restart
```

You can access the application now at: [http://localhost](http://localhost)
